            <p>
              Our mentors are students who have already completed at least one
              semester and volunteer to help new or incoming students navigate
              university life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mentoring is informal, supportive, and flexible. There is no
              obligation — either side can stop anytime. This is about building
              connections and making your transition to university smoother and
              more welcoming.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 italic">
              Whether you&apos;re a first-year student, international student, or
              just looking for guidance, our mentors are here to help you feel at
              home.
